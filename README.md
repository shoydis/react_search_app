Hacker News Search App:

React application that has two pages users can navigate to:

“/search” lets the user search the Hacker News Algolia API and displays a list of results (https://hn.algolia.com/api)
“/history” shows the users a list of their past searches from this session (these do not need to persist through refresh).
